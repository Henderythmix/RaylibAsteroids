# Raylib Asteroids
This is just a simple game of asteroids made in C++ with Raylib

# Building

This requires mingw64 and raylib.

This should compile fine by itself, but there is a possibility you will need to rebuild [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) for a compatible version of lib/libraylib.a

Just run `mingw32-make` to build and `mingw32-make run` to run the project
